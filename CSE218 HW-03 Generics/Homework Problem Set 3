Homework Problem Set 3

1. Rewrite the StackX class we wrote today to make it a generic class call GStack. The generic class
should work with any types of objects.

2. Add a method called pushAll to the above generic stack class. The method must allow the user
to add an array of objects to the stack. This method must avoid any runtime errors. 

3. Add a method called popAll to the above generic stack class. The method must allow the user to
remove the entire stack content in sequence and return an array of the removed objects to the
caller.

4. Write a generic bag class called NumberBag that can be used to store any types of Number
objects. The generic bag class must allow the user to insert, remove, find, and display the
numbers.

5. Write a generic bag class called GBag using an array to store any objects. Test the class with a
Demo class to store, find, delete, and display integers, and String, respectively.

6. Write another class called Student, which contains name (String), id (String), and gpa (double)
fields. Modify the above generic GBag class from the previous problem to store five students
with automatically generated id numbers. You will then find, delete, and display any student by
his/her id number.

7. Write another class called Faculty, which contains name, id, and salary fields. Modify the generic
GBag class from the previous problems, if necessary, to store five faculty and five students, and
then find, delete, and display either faculty or student by id number. All id numbers should be
automatically generated and there should not have any duplicated values between Students and
Faculty.
