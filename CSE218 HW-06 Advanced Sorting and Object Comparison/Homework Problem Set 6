Homework Problem Set 6

1. Write a program to use Quick Sort to sort an array of cois by their value

2. Implement a program that measures the performance of the quick sort algorithm by
using 100, 1000, and 10000 words, respectively. These words are captured from a text
file.

3. Write a program that sorts an ArrayList<Country> in decreasing order so that the largest
country is at the beginning of the array.

4. Modify the binary search program so if no match is found, the search method returns -k -
1, where k is the position before which the element should be inserted.This is the same
behavior as Arrays.binarySearch method.

5. Write a class Person that implements the Comparable interface. Compare persons by
their names. Ask the user to input ten names and generate ten Person objects. Using
the compareTo method, determine the first and last person among them and print them.

6. Sort an array list of strings by length, and so the strings of the same length are sorted
alphabetically.
