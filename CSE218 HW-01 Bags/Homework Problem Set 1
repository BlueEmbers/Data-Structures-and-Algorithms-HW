Homework Problem Set 1

1. Implement a Bag class to store and manipulate data of int type. The class should allow to add,
remove, and search any whole numbers. The remove and search methods should return a
boolean value of either true or false depending on whether the number is removed or found. In
addition, it should also contain findMax, findMin, and findMean methods that allow to search
for the largest, smallest and average values in the bag, respectively. Finally, it should have a
display method that will print the bag content on the console. Write a Demo class to
demonstrate the use of the Bag class.

2. Implement a Bag class to store and manipulate data of the Student type. The Student class must
have a name, ID Number, and GPA. The Bag class should allow to add, remove, and search any
student by his/her ID number. The remove and search methods should return a boolean value
of either true or false depending on whether the student (identified by his/her ID number) is
removed or found. In addition, it should also contain findMax, findMin and FindMean methods
that allow to search for the largest, smallest, and average GPA values in the bag, respectively,
and return these values accordingly. Finally, it should have a display method that will print the
bag content on the console. Write a Demo class to demonstrate the use of the Bag class.
