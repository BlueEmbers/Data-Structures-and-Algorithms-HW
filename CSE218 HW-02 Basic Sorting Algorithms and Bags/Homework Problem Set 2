Data Structures and Algorithms
Homework Problem Set 2

1. Write a Student class with name (String), id (int), and gpa (double) as fields. Write the usual
methods. In addition, write an equals() method that allows you to compare the object’s content
with another Student object, returning true if the two objects have the same content. Also,
write a constructor that will take an existing object to create another identical one. Finally, write
a deep copy method and a shallow method that will allow you to copy an existing object to
create another one. Write a demo to show how they work.

2. Use the code from the last problem, build a StudentBag class that will allow you to add student
objects into the bag and display the content of the bag. It will also allow you to find and remove
a given Student object by the id number from the bag. You must use an array as the underlying
data structure. Write a Demo program that will add 1000 student objects into the bag to test
the aforementioned methods. These objects should be generated through an automated
process.

3. Use the code from the last problem, but add three additional methods into the StudentBag
class. One will allow you to sort the students by name using bubble sort, one by id using
selection sort, and one by gpa by insertion sort. Test these methods using the 1000 objects
generated from the last problem. Finally, please provide a chart to show the performance of the
three sorting methods in terms of the amount of time used.
